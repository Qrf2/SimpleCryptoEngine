# SimpleCryptoEngine

A minimal C++ program that simulates basic cryptographic operations including bit-level permutation, S-box substitution, and swapping of data halves. This serves as a foundational demonstration of core concepts used in symmetric encryption algorithms.

## Features

- Binary input processing
- Permutation using a custom-defined table
- S-box substitution with configurable input
- Output transformation via half-swapping

## How to Run

1. Compile the code using any C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o crypto_demo crypto_demo.cpp
